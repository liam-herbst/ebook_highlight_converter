#This is a script for converting the ugly iBooks notes exports into a clean HTML file
# *** Turn these into angi HTML file and post them to a public website (similar to the notes
# app that has the spaced repitition system) and email a weblink to the person who emailed me
# also build up a massive email list and send out monthly upates
# see if there's a way to integrate with my existing notion page / profile (ZK)
