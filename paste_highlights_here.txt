NOTES FROM
The Trouble With Testosterone: And Other Essays on the Biology of the Human Predi

1: How Big Is Yours?
schizotypal personality disorder

I think Steve has this

10: The Burden of Being Burden-Free
People with anxiety disorders can be thought of as persistently mobilizing coping responses that are disproportionately large. For them, life is filled with threats around every corner, threats that demand a constant hyper-vigilance, an endless skittering search for safety, a sense that the rules are constantly changing

June 11, 2020
10: The Burden of Being Burden-Free
the key component of Type A personality is the hostility—they perceive a need for coping responses that are disproportionately large, and their coping responses are disproportionately likely to be angry ones

it takes a whole lot of energy to think and plan and avoid and deny all the time like a repressor

life.

People actually use more energy to repress emotional responses than to show them. Which means that the most anxious people may show nothing at all

10: The Burden of Being Burden-Free
A lesson of repressive personality types and their invisible burdens is that, sometimes, it can be enormously stressful to construct a world without stressors.

piece

Testosterone does not cause aggressive behaviour when it is within normal range

June 11, 2020
11: The Trouble with Testosterone
testosterone isn’t causing aggression, it’s exaggerating the aggression that’s already there.

June 11, 2020
11: The Trouble with Testosterone
The amygdala has its influence on aggression via that pathway, with bursts of electrical excitation called action potentials that ripple down the stria terminalis, putting the hypothalamus in a pissy mood

June 11, 2020
11: The Trouble with Testosterone
If and only if the amygdala is already sending an aggression-provoking volley of action potentials down the stria terminalis, testosterone increases the rate of such action potentials by shortening the resting time between them. It’s not turning on the pathway, it’s increasing the volume of signaling if it is already turned on

hormone

Testosterone does not initiate aggression, it only amplified the signal.

If you’re stressed, the signal will activate more often (therefore, someone with artificially heightened T from steroid use, is susceptible to bursts of rage)

But if you are contsantly signaling testosterone inducing responses to your body because you’re stressed, your body will surpress the amplifier (testosterone) so it is not always in a state of rage... (this leads to overall lower levels of T
