how quickly can I become rich? Quicker than you probably deserve, but slower than you would like

November 14, 2020
Dedication
Whatever qualities the rich may have, they can be acquired by anyone with the tenacity to become rich. The key, I think, is confidence. Confidence and an unshakable belief it can be done and that you are the one to do it. Tunnel vision helps. Being a bit of a shit helps. A thick skin helps. Stamina is crucial, as is a capacity to work so hard that your best friends mock you

what is the most precious thing in life that riches can supply? Easy. For me, it’s Time

In the words of the art collector and oil billionaire John Paul Getty: “If you can actually count your money, you are not really a rich man.”

Becoming rich does not guarantee happiness

1 - Pole Positions
No task is a long one but the task on which one dare not start. It becomes a nightmare. —CHARLES BAUDELAIRE

November 14, 2020
1 - Pole Positions
If young and relatively penniless, many will argue their lack of experience and capital (especially capital!) dooms them to decades of wage slavery. If slightly better off and on the way up with a halfway decent job and perhaps the probability of further advancement, the problem is often considered to be the loss of what they have already achieved. Plus the lack of capital. By the time one is a senior manager or professional, probably with a decent house, a mortgage and children, it is the risk to the security and happiness of the latter

November 14, 2020
1 - Pole Positions
Young, Penniless and Inexperienced? Excellent. You stand by far the best chance of becoming as rich as you please. You have an advantage that neither education nor upbringing, nor even money, can buy—you have almost nothing. And therefore you have almost nothing to lose

November 14, 2020
1 - Pole Positions
For a great many people, getting started on the road to wealth is the most difficult part

November 14, 2020

nearly all the great fortunes acquired by entrepreneurs arose because they had nothing to lose

November 14, 2020
1 - Pole Positions
Not knowing that something cannot be done, you are likely to waltz into uncharted minefields where angels before you have feared to dance

November 14, 2020

Conventional wisdom daunts initiative and offers far too many convenient reasons for inaction

November 14, 2020
1 - Pole Positions
stamina is your secret weapon

November 14, 2020
1 - Pole Positions
The first few million pounds I ever trousered were a direct result of trusting instincts entirely at odds with conventional wisdom of any sort

November 14, 2020
1 - Pole Positions
Conventional wisdom is usually right. But when it is wrong, it can offer quite extraordinary opportunities for those too stubborn or inexperienced to pay attention to well-meaning naysayers

November 14, 2020
1 - Pole Positions
The way will most likely be hard, your failures many. It will be fun and it will get a little hairy, even scary, at times. But the earlier you start and the more risks you are prepared to run, tempered by listening hard and choosing the right mountain (we’ll come to that later), the more certain it is that, sooner or later, you will find yourself with a small success on your hands

November 14, 2020

And one success, with luck, will lead to another

1 - Pole Positions
Fear is the little death, death by a thousand cuts,” goes the ancient Japanese saying. Nifty, but ultimately unhelpful. Similar to Shakespeare’s “Cowards die many times before their deaths: / The valiant never taste of death but once.”

it’s win-win. If they fail, they may well return to our company, especially if they remember that my senior colleagues and I sincerely wished them success in their new venture. Thus, if they fail, the company will be enhanced by their return. While if they should succeed—then we will be all richer for having an old alumnus as a friendly rival in the industry, rather than having created an enemy who wishes us anything but well

2 - A Million to One
If I had my time again, knowing what I know today, I would dedicate myself to making just enough to live comfortably (say $60 or $80 million), as quickly as I could—hopefully by the time I was thirty-five years old. I would then cash out immediately and retire to write poetry and plant trees

November 14, 2020
2 - A Million to One
Making money was, and still is, fun, but at one time it wreaked chaos upon my private life

There is no such thing as a permanent champ

whoever dies with the most toys doesn’t win. Real winners are people who know their limits and respect them

3 - Harnessing the Fear of Failure
Ralph Waldo Emerson: No matter how much faculty of idle seeing a man has, the step from knowing to doing is rarely taken

November 14, 2020
3 - Harnessing the Fear of Failure
“Once begun—the job’s half done.” Because taking that first, irrevocable step has proved to be the most difficult part of nearly every venture I have been involved in

November 14, 2020
3 - Harnessing the Fear of Failure
“A committee is a cul-de-sac down which ideas are lured and quietly strangled,”

November 14, 2020
3 - Harnessing the Fear of Failure
Fear of failure and the avoidance of blame, then, is what drives

November 14, 2020
3 - Harnessing the Fear of Failure
The first is our natural desire to avoid letting ourselves or others down, perhaps with calamitous financial repercussions. The second is the exposure of that failure to the outside world

November 14, 2020
3 - Harnessing the Fear of Failure
I regret the majority of the times I acquiesced in shilly-shallying and a retreat to safety. I would rather have tried and failed, in most cases, than have taken the safer course that so often appears to be wiser in the abstract

November 14, 2020
3 - Harnessing the Fear of Failure
letting others or yourself down and the consequent financial calamity. My response is: so what? You may let others down if you act. You may let yourself down if you do not act

far, far more likely) that you fear the embarrassment of failure more than the possible financial penalty

November 14, 2020
3 - Harnessing the Fear of Failure
fear of attempting something, the result of which cannot be easily hidden, weighs heavily in the balance, whether we are aware of it or not

November 14, 2020
3 - Harnessing the Fear of Failure
• If you are unwilling to fail, sometimes publicly, and even catastrophically, you stand very little chance of ever getting rich. • If you care what the neighbors think, you will never get rich. • If you cannot bear the thought of causing worry to your family, spouse or lover while you plow a lonely, dangerous road rather than taking the safe option of a regular job, you will never get rich. • If you have artistic inclinations and fear that the search for wealth will coarsen such talents or degrade them, you will never get rich. (Because your fear, in this instance, is well justified.) • If you are not prepared to work longer hours than almost anyone you know, despite the jibes of colleagues and friends, you are unlikely to get rich. • If you cannot convince yourself that you are “good enough” to be rich, you will never get rich. • If you cannot treat your quest to get rich as a game, you will never be rich. • If you cannot face up to your fear of failure, you will never be rich

Treating the quest to get rich as a game is fascinating. It takes away so much of the fear of failure and makes it more fun

November 14, 2020
3 - Harnessing the Fear of Failure
getting rich means sacrifice. And the worst of it is, it isn’t always you that’s doing the sacrificing

November 14, 2020
3 - Harnessing the Fear of Failure
fear of failing in the eyes of the world is the single biggest impediment to amassing wealth

November 14, 2020
3 - Harnessing the Fear of Failure
If you shy away for any reason whatever, then the way is blocked. The gate is shut—and will remain shut

4 - The Search
“Luck is preparation multiplied by opportunity.” — SENECA, ROMAN PHILOSOPHER “The harder I practiced, the luckier I got.” — GARY PLAYER, GOLF CHAMPION “Luck is a dividend of sweat.” —RAY KROC, MCDONALD’S FOUNDER

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
the vast majority of people doing the asking did not choose their own career. Either they stumbled into it or they were pushed

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
if you feel absolutely moved toward a particular vocation, then that’s exactly where you should head

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
the salary begins to have an attraction and addictive-ness all of its own

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
If you want to be rich, you are not looking for a “career,” except as a launch pad or as a chance to infiltrate and understand a particular industry

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
“team spirit” and not letting your colleagues down is a feeble reason for procrastination when opportunity comes knocking

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
Those who can never be rich may not want you to become rich

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
Too many people want to make a blockbuster movie and live in Beverly Hills. Not enough people want to dig holes

The best opportunities are likely unglamorous (b/c of the supply demand for opportunities.. the demand exceeds supply for attractive opportunities)

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
New or rapidly developing industries, whether glamorous or not, very often provide more opportunities to get rich than established sectors

Ugly, new, low barrier to entry, and rapidly growing are the ideal industry traits

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
to acquire capital you need to be where loose capital is searching for a home

Loose capital is currently seeking a home in venture...

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
the combination of ignorance and misconception that surrounds any new market or technology works in your favor. If you are quick at grasping concepts and jargon, you become an “instant expert.” The owners of capital love “experts.”

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
whoever takes the most financial risk calls the piper’s tune. The biggest rewards go not to those individuals who came up with the idea, nor to those individuals who built the empire. They go to those entities or individuals who funded the enterprise and own the most stock

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
control, even by a single percent of the shares of a business, the fabled 51-49 percent split, is often the be-all and end-all of the game

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
Search: inclination, aptitude and fate

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
ruthlessly analyze what your particular aptitudes are and act upon them

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
confidence, a key element in risk taking, and the only way I know of to get rich from a standing start

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
The filthy rich are not gods. They are men and women who put on their underwear in the morning pretty much as you do

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
All around us, every day, opportunities to get rich are popping up. The more alert you are, the more chance you have of spotting them. The more preparation you have done, the more chance you have of succeeding. The more bold you are, the better chance you have of getting in on the ground floor and confounding the odds. The more self-belief you can muster, the more certain will be your aim and your timing. And the less you care what the neighbors think, the more likely you are to take the plunge and exploit an opportunity

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
never shrink when opportunities arrive. If you have weighed the odds and find yourself convinced, ignore the protestations of sensible people and their conventional caution.

November 14, 2020
4 - The Search
Those who are prepared to analyze the risk, to bear the humiliation and to act in deadly earnest—these are the “lucky” ones who will find themselves, when the music stops, holding a potful of money

November 14, 2020
5 - The Fallacy of the Great Idea
It is good to have a goal. True believers in a “great idea” are often obsessed with achieving a particular goal

November 14, 2020
5 - The Fallacy of the Great Idea
wealth rarely finds its way into the pockets of the person whose obsession created it

November 14, 2020
5 - The Fallacy of the Great Idea
If you never have a single great idea in your life, but become skilled in executing the great ideas of others, you can succeed beyond your wildest dreams

November 14, 2020
5 - The Fallacy of the Great Idea
Ideas don’t make you rich. The correct execution of ideas does

6 - Obtaining Capital
There are only six ways of obtaining capital. You can be given or inherit it; you can steal it; you can win it; you can marry it; you can earn it; you can borrow it

November 14, 2020
6 - Obtaining Capital
if you can demonstrate the ability to earn money early on, it does become somewhat easier to borrow from others successfully later

dolphins—a nickname deriving from their frantic desire to “flip” every deal as quickly as possible. By “flipping, ” I mean a sale. They do not care who the venture is sold to (yourself or an outside party), but the return of their investment

VC are dolphins

Fishes come in all shapes and sizes. Friends, acquaintances, relatives, business colleagues, small investors, friendly bank managers of the old school, professional advisors, ex-employers, suppliers and vendors are among them

Fishes are people who are willing to help you out a little in the short run to get your venture off the ground (who you pay back long term)

ingredient. I would not be a wage slave. I would not take “no” for an answer. I would not give in. I was going to be rich. Some how. Some way. Someday soon. And I would not retreat to the safety of a decent job until I was starved out of house and home. I would not give in.

November 14, 2020
7 - Never Give In
all I knew was—you guessed it—I would not give in.

November 14, 2020
7 - Never Give In
if you want to be rich, then you must walk a narrow, lonely road to get the capital to make it so

November 14, 2020
8 - The Five Most Common Start-Up Errors

Ideally, you should never do it at all

November 14, 2020
8 - The Five Most Common Start-Up Errors
improve cash flow by observing the following suggestions in a start-up’s early days: • Keep payroll down to an absolute minimum. Overhead walks on two legs. • Never sign long-term rent agreements or take upmarket office space. • Never indulge in fancy office or reception furniture, unless your particular business demands that you make such an impression on clients. • Never buy a business meal if the other side offers to. You can show off later. • Pay yourself just enough to eat. • Do not be shy to call customers who owe you money personally . It works. • In a city, walk everywhere you can. It’s healthy and sets a good example. • Check all staff travel and entertainment claims with an eagle eye. • If you’re going to be late paying, call the vendor’s boss. Give a date. Stick to it. • Always meet payroll, even at the expense of starving yourself that week. • Issuing staff credit cards, company cell phones or cars is the road to ruin. • Leaving lights, computers, printers and copiers on overnight is just stupid. • A vase of beautiful flowers in reception every week creates a better impression than £100,000 worth of fancy Italian furniture. • Get used to groveling.

November 15, 2020
8 - The Five Most Common Start-Up Errors
It is this possibility , the chance that we are onto a slow-burn winner, rather than being stuck with an out-and-out loser, that persuades so many of us (who should know better) to hang in there with a product or service in financial trouble

Once you begin to believe that you are infallible, that success will automatically lead to more success, and that you have “got it made,” reality will be sure to give you a rude wake-up call

November 15, 2020
8 - The Five Most Common Start-Up Errors
By acting small, I mean remaining in touch. Remaining flexible. Constantly examining how your company could do better. Keeping a sense of proportion and humility

November 15, 2020

November 15, 2020
8 - The Five Most Common Start-Up Errors

November 15, 2020

there is a downside to all this intelligence and imagination. He thinks a little too much before he acts. He weighs the options too carefully. He is capable of imagining defeat. So while he is clever enough to want to minimize his risk by switching to yet another new and uncontested marketplace, he leads himself into uncertainty. And into error.

• Prepare yourself for luck, but don’t seek her out. Let her come to you. • Make your own luck • Don’t whine or ever describe yourself as “unlucky.” (You’re alive, aren’t you?) • Be bold. Be brave. Don’t thank your lucky stars. The stars can’t hear you. • Stay the course. Stop looking for the green grass over the hill. • Don’t try to do it all yourself. Delegate and teach others to delegate. • Remember that most predators are lucky most of their lives, unlike their prey. • Whiners and cowards die a hundred times a day. Be a hero to yourself. • If being a hero isn’t your style, then fake it. Reality will catch up eventually. • Just do it. It is much easier to apologize than to obtain permission. • Never take the quest for wealth seriously. It’s just a game, chum. • Next time you bump into Lady Luck, giver her a whack on the rump from me. • Be lucky. Get rich. Then give it all away. (We’ll get to that bit later.) • Don’t call your son “Albert.” (Just joking!)

11 - The Art of Negotiating
Weaknesses in serious negotiations usually exist in both camps, of course, at least to some degree or another, and it becomes important to swiftly determine which weakness is most pressing and most potentially catastrophic to which party. An immediate balance of weaknesses may well prove more decisive than any long-term balance of strengths

Think of negotiations in terms of weakness (not strength)

What do institutional investors in huge corporations have to do with developing serious negotiating skills as an entrepreneur and getting rich? Everything, my friend. Everything

Institutional investors will push bug corporations to be ‘up to date’ with their tech/business and acquiring a startup is often the route to do that. Corporations have to makes these acquisitions so they keep getting money from institutional investors

• The flea has established to his own satisfaction the elephant’s urgent need. • The flea has learned to ignore flattery. • The flea has learned that an elephant cannot be your friend in negotiations. • The flea has learned he is not a good negotiator. • The flea has learned to “empty” himself and make himself believe he does not care. • The flea has overcome his lack of skill by setting a price he will not deviate from. • The flea has hardened his heart and has walked away when the price was not met. • The flea has introduced a rogue element (the trade magazine) into the negotiations. • The flea has weighed Greed vs. Need. He believes Need will outweigh Greed

How can anyone truly “own” anything? Surely the answer is that we can claim no such thing

November 15, 2020
12 - Ownership! Ownership! Ownership!
I may well have been only able to put a few hundred million dollars in the bank because I recognized that this getting rich malarkey is just a game. A delusion, if you will.

Being rich is fine, and at the very least is better than being poor. But it shouldn’t be the be-all and end-all of your life, or anyone’s life

But if you chase money desperately in the earnest belief that you can never be happy without it and seriously think that the chase is a meaningful occupation, I doubt very much you will succeed

Why Ownership Isn’t the Important Thing—It’s the Only Thing

November 15, 2020
12 - Ownership! Ownership! Ownership!
To become rich you must be an owner. And you must try to own it all. You must strive with every fiber of your being, while recognizing the idiocy of your behavior, to own and retain control of as near to 100 percent of any company as you can

November 15, 2020
12 - Ownership! Ownership! Ownership!
To become rich, every single percentage point of anything you own is crucial. It is worth fighting for, tooth and claw

November 15, 2020
12 - Ownership! Ownership! Ownership!
Never, never, never, never hand over a single share of anything you have acquired or created if you can help it

November 15, 2020

David and Robin never owned anything during their time there except for a pile of EMAP share options, a good salary and a lovely pension

November 15, 2020
12 - Ownership! Ownership! Ownership!
Nothing counts but what you own in the race to get rich. If you haven’t much skill, or much wit, or much talent, or much luck, and yet you insist on owning more than your fair share of any start-up or acquisition, then you can become rich. If you take what you’re given, you will probably not get rich

November 15, 2020
12 - Ownership! Ownership! Ownership!
ownership isn’t the important thing. If you want to be rich, it’s the only thing

13 - The Joys of Delegation
Actors, celebrities, kings, politicians, artists and a host of others, either do the job in person, or they lose the job—and the income that comes with the job

Interesting point for celebrity venture investing... they’re paid for their uniqueness but they cannot delegate themselves (I.e. they’re unscalable)

November 15, 2020
13 - The Joys of Delegation
delegation and promotion are among your most powerful weapons in getting rich

Bring in people who offset your weaknesses and delegate to them

almost everyone wishes to be respected. With promotion comes respect

November 15, 2020

It’s so easy to delegate important work to people who are similar in temperament and skill-sets to you, or to promote them. So easy and so wrong

November 15, 2020
13 - The Joys of Delegation
The work undertaken by your colleagues and employees is more important than your work. Your job is merely to lead, perhaps just to point in the right direction

November 15, 2020
13 - The Joys of Delegation
I only started to get rich when I began to delegate and to ease up on my work schedule

November 15, 2020

I have devised a system where I keep overall control, but do not involve myself in running a business unless I wish to get involved for a particular reason

Without my express permission: 1. They may not vote anyone on or off the board. 2. They may not physically move the headquarters of the company. 3. They may not dispose of, or shut down, any substantial asset. 4. They may not purchase, or launch, any substantial new product or business. 5. They may not award themselves bonuses or salary increases

November 15, 2020
13 - The Joys of Delegation
I have been known to wreak physical violence on a cell phone that begins to squawk in the middle of meetings, or on a BlackBerry which is being used surreptitiously under the table by its owner. Not only is it bad manners, such interruptions break the flow and concentration necessary for real decision-making

November 15, 2020
13 - The Joys of Delegation
If you want to get rich, then learn to delegate. Don’t learn to pretend to delegate. Delegation is not only a powerful tool, it is the only way to maximize and truly incentivize your most precious asset—the people who work for you

14 - A Piece of the Pie
10. Offer legal perks that you have paid for yourself to employees. This sounds crazy, but it works. I allow my employees, for example, the use of my Rolls-Royces or Bentleys for their weddings. I permit them to stay at my homes around the world if they have performed well

November 15, 2020
14 - A Piece of the Pie
12. Encourage senior managers to go over annual results with you one-on-one. You will learn more from off-the-cuff remarks and opinions expressed at one-on-one meetings while looking over financial results than you will in a dozen board meetings

I have never known a single person in a rival organization, however well paid or cosseted, who has refused to meet me for a quiet drink after work. I have discovered more about what my rivals are up to in this manner than any other

Bonuses should be more than competitive, they should be tempting, generous and based ruthlessly on meritocracy and delivery. That’s the way to get employees to really focus. You don’t want people to apply to work for you because of the salaries on offer—they should be driven by other desires

when you first began coming around after Sally, I asked you what you were going to do when you left school. You looked me in the eye. Your eyes weren’t like any teenager I ever knew. They were fierce, like a tiger’s. You were insolent and arrogant and frightening. I told my husband so.” “I’m sorry for that.” “You told me you were going to get rich.
