# Ebook Highlight Converter
The Ebook converter is a simple program for converting ugly iBooks and Kindle highlights into a pretty HTML file. The file can be viewed on the web or in a note taking application such as Notion.

# How to Use:
**You must you run the corresponding file for the type of notes (iBooks or Kindle) you've imported.**

## iBook Exports
### 1. Clone this Repository (i.e. Folder of files) from Github:
1. If you're new to Github, you can follow [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to learn how to download this folder to your system. 
2. You'll also need to have a text editor installed for simplicity. I recomommend installing [Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and installing the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) for running the file.
### 2. Copy, Paste & Save Your Notes
1. Open your email export and hit 'command + a' ('control + a' for PC users) to select your entire notes.
